Encrypt a message or phrase using the Caesar Cipher encryption method 

Caesar Cipher encryption is a method of substitution cipher where each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

### Features of Caesar-Cipher</br>
--> Each charecter of a message can be shifted ahead to any number as per choice. </br>
--> For example: With a key of 3, every 'A' in the message shifts 3 letters in the alphabet and becomes 'D'; 'B' becomes 'E'; 'Y' becomes 'C' and so on.</br>
--> Encrypt as well as decrypt a ciphered message.</br>
</br>
More features coming soon!

<i>Next update in works: Adding a reverse auto deciphering system using a dictionary.</i>

<i>I have uploaded the codes for the cipher in C++ in two methods: single-function and OOP (in class), both tested and working.
